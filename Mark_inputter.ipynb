    "### Question 01\n",
    "Suppose, you are a developer of a software company named 'Hacker Man'.Your supervisor asked you to develop a password generator program, for MIPS architecture, that can both generate passwords and break them. After building   the   program,   you   observed   that,   the   program   was   taking  $X$ milliseconds to execute and the password generation was taking 90% ofthe total execution time (Here $X$ is your **BRACU ID**. For example, if your ID is **12456789** then the time is **12456789 milliseconds**). After reporting  to your boss fearfully, he said it was unacceptable andthreatened   to   fire   you   unless   you   can   increase   the   whole   program'sperformance by a factor of 5 by optimizing the password generation. Now, your job's future rest in your optimization skills and the results of your analysis. Let's start with the analysis."

    "In the meantime, you are thinking if you can decrease the execution time of the password breaking operation. You thought of a slight optimization of that operation and made some rough calculations. You optimized your algorithm to have an average CPI of Y and instruction count of $Y\\times10^7$ (Here $Y$ is the third digit of your **BRACU ID**. For example, if your ID is **12456789** then instructioncount will be $4\\times10^7$). Now answer the following question.\n",

    "How   much   processing   speed   would   you   require   forrunning the optimized algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANSWER**: It is aksing to calculate the clock rate in GHz or MHz. When calculating it, the students have to determine which execution time to use. The executiom time would be actually T_unaffected (password breaking time or the 10% of the BRACU ID time). However, there were some misunderstanding. So, we can give marks for 3 Cases as there were some misunderstanding regarding the question. DO NOT give marks if the calculation is outside these cases:\n",

    "3. Execution time =  Optimized execution time (BRACU ID / 5 milliseconds)"
