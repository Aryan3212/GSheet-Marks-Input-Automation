# GSheet-Marks-Input-Automation

In this small project, I used the Google Sheets and Google Drive API to automate the mark inputting for students in my assigned sections as the Student Tutor(Undergraduate Teaching Assistant) at my department. I managed to successfully do it for about 150 students saving me a lot of time, trying to find their name on the sheet and input their marks which may lead to human errror.
